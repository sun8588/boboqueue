# godis

Implements a few database clients for Redis.

There is a stable client and an experimental client, `redis`
and `exp`, respectively. To use any of them simply add.

    import "github.com/simonz05/godis/redis"

or 

    import "github.com/simonz05/godis/exp"

Both versions provide a `redis` package which is used to
create a client and talk to the database. For a quick start
check out either projects readme and example. Package
reference is also available.
